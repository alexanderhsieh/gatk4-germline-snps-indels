## This WDL implements the joint discovery and VQSR filtering portion of the GATK 
## Best Practices (June 2016) for germline SNP and Indel discovery in human 
## whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and exome sequencing data.
##
## Requirements/expectations :
## - One or more GVCFs produced by HaplotypeCaller in GVCF mode 
## - Bare minimum 1 WGS sample or 30 Exome samples. Gene panels are not supported.
##
## Outputs :
## - A VCF file and its index, filtered using variant quality score recalibration 
##   (VQSR) with genotypes for all samples present in the input VCF. All sites that 
##   are present in the input VCF are retained; filtered sites are annotated as such 
##   in the FILTER field.
##
## Note about VQSR wiring :
## The SNP and INDEL models are built in parallel, but then the corresponding 
## recalibrations are applied in series. Because the INDEL model is generally ready 
## first (because there are fewer indels than SNPs) we set INDEL recalibration to 
## be applied first to the input VCF, while the SNP model is still being built. By 
## the time the SNP model is available, the indel-recalibrated file is available to 
## serve as input to apply the SNP recalibration. If we did it the other way around, 
## we would have to wait until the SNP recal file was available despite the INDEL 
## recal file being there already, then apply SNP recalibration, then apply INDEL 
## recalibration. This would lead to a longer wall clock time for complete workflow 
## execution. Wiring the INDEL recalibration to be applied first solves the problem.
##
## Cromwell version support 
## - Successfully tested on v47
## - Does not work on versions < v23 due to output syntax
##
## Runtime parameters are optimized for Broad's Google Cloud Platform implementation. 
## For program versions, see docker containers.
